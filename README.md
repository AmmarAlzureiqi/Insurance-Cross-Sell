# Customersʼ Interest on Vehicle Insurances

## Introduction


An Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers wishes to build a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year a customer needs to pay a premium of a certain amount to the insurance company so that in case of an unfortunate accident by the person driving the vehicle, the insurance company will provide compensation (called ʻsum assuredʼ) to the customer.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimize its business model and revenue.

## Dataset description

The dataset is available on Kaggle, provided by one whose client is an Insurance company. There are three datasets available: train.csv, test.csv, and sub.csv. The test.csv file is for prediction and does not include a response variable while the sub.csv file is for submission of the predicted response. Since we are only interested in the relationship between the response and the predictors, and not the predictions themselves, we have only made use of the train.csv file, which contains the necessary data.

The dataset called train.csv includes the following 12 variables:
